You may have to pay royalties and othe r \\nfees even if you are losing money.  \\n \\nBusiness model can change .  The franchise agreement may allow the franchisor \\nto change its manuals and business model without your consent.  These changes \\nmay require you to make additional investme nts in your franchise  business or may \\nharm your franchise business.  \\n \\nSupplier restrictions .  You may have to buy or lease items from the franchi sor or \\na limited group of suppliers the franchisor designates.  These items may be more \\nexpensive than sim ilar items you could buy on  your own.   \\n \\nOperating  restrictions .  The franchise agreement may prohibit you from operating \\na similar business during th e term of the franchise.  There are usually other \\nrestrictions.  Some examples may include controlling your location, your access to \\ncustom ers, what you se ll, how you mar ket, and your hours of operation.  \\n \\nCompetition from franchisor.  Even if the franchise agreement grants you a \\nterritory, the franchisor may have the right to compete with you in your territory.  \\n \\nRene wal.  Your franchise agreeme nt may not per mit you to rene w.  Even if it does, \\nyou may have to sign a new agreement with different terms and conditions in order to contin ue to operate your franchise business.   \\n \\nWhen your franchise ends .  The franchise agreement may prohibit y ou fro m \\noperating a si milar business after your franchise ends even if y ou still have \\nobligations to your landlord or other creditors.   \\n \\nSome States Require Registration  \\n \\nYour state may have a franchise law, or other law, that re quires  franchisors to \\nregister b efore offering or selling franchises in the state.  Registration d oes not \\nmean that the state recommends the franchise or has verified the information in this \\ndocument.  To find out if your state has a registration requireme nt, or  to contact \\nyour sta te, us e the agency infor mation in Exhibit A. \\n \\nYour state also may have l aws that require special disclosures or amendments be \\nmade to your franchise agreement.

Out-of-State Dispute Resolution.  The franchise agreement requires you to \\nresolve disputes with the franchisor by med iation, arbitratio n, and/or lit igation \\nonly in Michigan.

The market  for coffee b usinesses  is developing.   There is substantial \\ncompetition in the retail coffee business.  Examples of competitors  include n ational, regional and \\nlocal, franchised and independently owned coffee b usinesses, mail order, restaura nts, gr ocery \\nstores, bulk foo d stores , department stores  and convenience stores . \\n \\n The market for coffee businesses  could be affected by pandem ics, such as the COVID 19 \\npandemic.  These ef fects may be experience d while the pandemic and any soci al distancin g \\npolicies, volu ntary or mandatory shu tdowns, and other governmental policies and requirements \\nrelating to the pandemic are in effect.  The mar ket could also be affected by natural disaste rs, such \\nas hurricanes and floods.  The effects from pan demics and n atural  disasters  may include the \\nunavailability of employees, reduced hours of operation or closing of the business for a period of \\ntime, reduc ed sales v olumes and cash flows, and disrupti ons to supply chains.  \\n \\nRegulations  \\n \\n There are no regula tions specif ic to the indust ry in which the BIGGBY® COFFEE  franchise \\noperates.

The purpose of  the PCI Requirements is to ensure the \\nprotection and privacy of customer information and c redit card n umbers .  The PCI  Requirements \\nrequire secured data connections  and other steps to protect informat ion.  The PCI Requirements \\nare substan tial an d complex and c hange regularly, so you must devote material business and \\nmanagement time and effort t o your compl iance efforts.   You could incur signif icant liability if there \\nis credit card fraud and you have not complied with the PCI Requirements.  \\n \\n There may be other laws and regulations applicabl e to your business and we urge you to \\nmake inquiries about any laws or reg ulations t hat may impact your bu siness.  \\n \\nPrior Business Experience  \\n  We do not operate a bus iness of the type to be operated by our franc hisees.

As of Decem ber 31, 2020, there were 245 franchised Store s in operation.  For the \\ninformat ion in Charts 1 and 2 and for the s ame- store Unit Sales growth  information in \\nChart 3, we used revenue information from a subset of 202 of our 245 franchi sed Stores in \\noperation at t he end of  2020 (143 of these Stores , which are the Stores with a drive- thru, \\nare included in Chart 1 and 59 of thes e Stores , which are t he Stores without a drive -thru, \\nare included in Chart 2) .  These 202 Stores constitute all of the franchised S tores in \\noperation at the end of 2020 that were in operat ion for at l east 13  mont hs at the end of \\n2020, other than kiosk Stores (ki osk S tores are  Stores that are housed inside another retail \\nbusiness operation) and S tores that were not open seven days a week ; provided t hat, we \\nexcluded 20 Stores that were closed for at least 40 days in 2020 due to the COVID 19 \\npandemi c.  Some of the 202 Stores were closed for 39 days or less du ring 2020.   For the \\ninformation in Cha rt 3 (other than same- store Unit Sales growth) , Chart 4, and Chart 5 we \\nused revenue and expense informat ion from a subset of 71 of our 245 franchised Stores  in \\noperation at the end of  2020.  These 71 Stores are Stores that we believe provi de us with \\nconsistent and accurate expense data,  are a reasonable representation of o ur franchise \\nsyste m, and wer e closed for no more than 39 day s in 2020.  The Stores represented  in the \\nCharts may differ m aterially  from a Store that may be operated by you because these \\nStores have been operated for a longer  period of time and by a more experie nced \\noperator.   \\n \\n2. The informati on contained in Char t 1, Chart 2,  and C hart 3 is based on inf ormation \\nreported to us by the Stores  in each subset for the year ending December 31, 2020. \\nExcept as described below , the percentages  used f or the break -even analysis  in Chart 4 \\nare from the av erages of t he Chart 4 subset of  Store s for the year endi ng December  31, \\n2020.  We d etermined these averages based on information reported to us by these \\nStores.  Any al terations in t he data from t he Char t 4 subset are noted below .  The financ ial \\ninformation from our  Stores has not been audited a nd we do not know if the information \\nwas pr epared in accordanc e with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  \\n \\n3. “Unit Sales ,” as us ed in the Charts, means the entire revenues of the Store , less sales \\ntaxes  and refunds , but not including any reduction for disc ounts .  “Gross Sales,” as used in \\nthe Franchise Agreemen t, mean s all revenues of the S tore minus sales taxes paid, \\ndiscounts , and refunds.   \\n \\n4. The “Gross P rofit” as a percentage of the Unit  Sales  average of our Chart 4  subset of \\nStores, which is the perc entag e used in the bre ak-even anal ysis in Char t 4, is 62.31% .  \\nThe Gross Profi t is cal culated by taki ng Unit Sales and subtr acting d iscounts as an \\naverage percentage and then Cost of Sales as an average percentage.  61 of the 71 \\nStores  (85.91%) in th e subset g roup met or exc eeded t his average G ross Profit \\npercentage.  \\n 5. The “Operating Expenses”  as a percentage of the Unit Sales  used i n the break -even \\nanalysis in Chart 4 is 60.27%.  The detailed calculati on for this percentage is in Chart 5 \\nbelow.   Some of the Stores  in the Chart  4 subse t reported automoti ve and meal s and \\nentertainment expens es.  We di d not include t hose expenses in our  analysis .

Those subcategories and cer tain ass umptions  \\nrelating to thos e subcat egories are as  follows : \\n \\n(A) Labor —29.62% .  This subcategory includes the pers onnel cost s in Chart  3.  The \\nlabor expenses subc ategor y is not an average of the subset Stores, but is instead \\nan as sumption based on two baristas at $ 9.65 per hour ( minimum  wage in \\nMichigan as of January 1, 2020) for 1 6.5 hours per day.  This does not incl ude a \\nmanager’s salary.  This percentage includes work er’s compensation insurance, \\npayroll taxes and training ex pens es relating to the two barist a employ ees, w hich is  \\nbased on informat ion from  the subset Stores.  \\n \\n(B) Services— 9.93%.  This subcategory inclu des the l aundry, uniform s, bank service \\ncharges , credit card processing, insurance, license and permits, penalties and \\nfines, professional servi ces, telephone and ut ilities expenses i n Chart 5 . \\n (C) Administration— 9.97%.  This subcategory includes the office suppli es, postage, \\noccupancy cost, including rent, and travel expenses in Chart 5 .   \\n \\n(D) Marketing and Royalty —8.73%.  This subcategor y incl udes the adver tising,  \\nmarketing and franchise r oyalty expenses in Chart 5 .  Some Stor es included in this \\nanalys is pay a r oyalty of 5% of  Gross Sales  and others  pay a royalty of 6% of Gross \\nSales .  New franchi ses will pay a royalty of 6% of Gross Sal es, which will increase \\nthis percentage.   \\n \\n(E) Operati ons—2.06%.  This subcategor y includes the smallwar es, chemicals,  freight, \\nmaintenance and repair expenses in Chart 5. \\n \\n6. There is no depreciation or amorti zation expensed in the C hart 4 break -even analysis.  \\n \\n7. The i nteres t expense under the “Other Income  (Expens e)” category in C hart 4 is not  an \\naverage of the subset Sto res but  is instead an ass umption based on bor rowing  $150,000 \\nat 6% interest.  There are  no principal payments expenses in these calculations.  \\n \\n8. The “Net Income” shown i n the break -even analysis i n Chart 4 is $0 as this C hart is \\nintended to show a break -even scenario. The average Net Income for our Chart 4 subset \\nof Stores, which includes officer/guaranteed payments and automotive and meals and \\nentertainment expenses but does not include depreciati on or amortization, is $85,325.03  \\n(the median is $97, 921). Net Income as a percentage of the Unit  Sales average of our \\nChart 4 subset of St ores, which is the percentage used in the break -even analysis in Chart \\n4, is 11.56%  (the m edian is 13.27% ).  The Net Income is calculated by taking Gross \\nIncome and subtracting Operating Expenses as an average percentage and then Other \\nIncome (Expenses) as an average percentage.  57 of the 71 St ores in the subset group \\n(80.28% ) met or exceeded this average Gross Profit percentage \\n \\n9. In arrivin g at the number of cups s old per day to break -even, we hav e assumed Unit Sales \\nper cup of $5.96.  This figure is not an av erage of the Chart 4  subset of Stores but  is an \\naverage of the Chart 1  and Chart 2 subset of Stores .  \\n \\n10.

Our philosophy is that technology should never hinder the daily operations of your  busines s. \\nTechnology should smoothly integrate into and facilitate the operations of a BIGGBY COFFEE s tore.  \\n \\nIn an effort to keep fees to a minimum, Global Orange operates the support contract on a revenue -neutral basis. \\nIt is our objective to restrict fees collected from the Franchise Owner to the actual cost of providing the service.  \\n 1. Benefits  \\n \\nBy accepting the support contract , you will receive the benefits described below. The end goal of these services \\nis to keep your POS equipment functio nal and up -to-date at all times at a reasonable cost  to you.  \\n \\na. Hardware and Software Support  \\n \\nAll hardware and software that has been purchased from us or approved by us is covered for technical \\nissues, defects, and failures , subject to the exclusions described below. We will troubleshoot and repair, \\nthrough a variety of means o utlined later in the support contract, any issues that affect your system.  \\n \\nb. Hardware Upgrades  \\n \\nWe want BIGGBY COFFEE stores to be running on the newest and most r eliable equipment that our \\ntechnology budget will allow. O lder equipment be comes less reliable as it ages and cost -prohibitive to \\nmaintain. As a method for preventing long- term system ic problems , the  support contract provides hardware \\nlife-cycle management.  \\n All hardware will be reviewed annually, and replaced or reconfigured every 5 -7 years; earlier, in the event of \\na hardware failure or the determination that technology is “end of life”.  \\n At the time of a swap, you will relinquish ownership of the old piece of equipment and accept ownership of \\nthe new or refurbis hed piece of equipment.   We will make a best -effort attempt to transfer all personal \\ndata  and software licensing  to the replacement equipment.  The replacement equipment will continue to be \\ncovered under this contract . \\n \\nA special cash assessment, beyond t he cost of this contract, may be required in order to keep up with \\ntechnology changes. These required assessments will be kept to a minimum cost and frequency.  We will provide a minimum of 60 -day notice of any upcoming assessments, longer if possible.  \\n \\nc. Proactive Services  \\n \\nOne of the best ways to keep systems running at their maximum performance  and prevent failures before \\nthey happen is through continuous monitoring and regular maintenance.  \\n ', metadata={'source': 'T:\\\\Destktop\\\\m_chatbot\\\\Data\\\\1.pdf', 'page': 248}),\n",

However, if it is used for anything else, you may be billed for data overages.  There are no \\nguaranteed data speeds for this service. The data s peeds will be limited by the strength of the signal at your \\nlocation, the interference encountered within your office, the capabilities of your modem, and other factors.  \\nThe initial cost and replacement cost of this device is NOT covered by this agreement.  \\n \\n2.

You can expect to hear back \\nfrom someone  as outlined in the response times later i n the support contract.  \\n Once you are in touch with a technician, they will remote ly connect to your system to diagnose \\nand attempt to fix the problem. If connectivity is unavailable, they will provide phone support to \\nget a connection up and running, and then resume with resolving the issue.  \\n ', metadata={'source': 'T:\\\\Destktop\\\\m_chatbot\\\\Data\\\\1.pdf', 'page': 250}),\n",

Replacement Parts  \\n \\nIf a technician determines that your issue is caused by a faulty piece of hardware, we will \\nattempt to put your system into one of the various modes of redundancy to at least get you up \\nand running for the time being.   This could entail  putting the terminal in standalone mode, \\nchanging network setups, or any of a number of temporary fixes.  \\n \\nIf the store is a non -drive thru location , a technician will bring the replacement hardware to the \\nstore. If the store is a drive thru location and has at least one functioning POS , the technician \\nwill ship out a replacement piece of equipment overnight. Included in this will be a box  or return \\nlabel for you to re turn the old piece of equipment.  \\n \\nOnce you have the equipment, you can contact the Franchise Community Line to have them \\nconnect you with a technician that will walk you through replacing the equipment. They will \\nthen verify everything is working and make sure your data and settings are intact.  \\n \\niii. Continued Support and On- Site Service  \\n \\nIf for any reason your problem persists beyond a replacement part, we will try further \\ntroubleshooting to fix the issue. If we are able to , we will find  a suitable solution via another \\nreplacement part. However, if we are unsure of what the problem is, or if you have replaced \\ntwo separate replacement parts and the issue persists, we will send out a technician on -site to \\nservice your system.  If when at the  site the technician determines the cause of the issue is \\nrelated to user error, or other devices not installed or supported by Global Orange Development \\nyou may be billed for services . \\n \\nb. Emergency vs. Non- Emergency  \\n \\nIMPORTANT: All emergencies must be called in  to the FCL.  \\n \\nThe primary factor that will determine how we prioritize  support tickets is whether the issue is considered \\nan emergency.  We define a n emergency  as something that completely disables one of the core \\ntechnological functions of your  business . For the purposes of response times and after -hours support, an \\nemergency must be one of the following:  \\ni. You are unable to ring up orders on the POS terminal.  \\nii. You are unable to accept credit card transactions.  \\niii. Your back of house computer  is unresponsive or unable to start.  \\niv. Your internet has been consistently down for more than 30 minutes.  \\n \\nc. Support Hours  \\n \\ni. Monday through Friday  \\na. Regular phone support will be available from 7:00AM to 7:00PM.  \\nb. Emergency on call phone support will be available from 12:00AM –  7:00AM and again at \\n7:00PM.  \\nc.

Response Times  \\n \\nPhone support will be responded to on both a time and priority basis. When calling during regular support \\nhours (above), emergencies will be responded to within 30 minutes .  Non-emergenci es will be responded to \\nwithin 1 hour . When calling outside of regular supp ort hours, emergenci es will be responded to within 1 \\nhour , while non -emergenc ies will be responded to wi thin 1  hour  of the opening hour of the next normal \\nbusiness  day. Replacement parts will be shipped overnight within 24 hours of determining a replacement \\npart is needed. On -site support times will vary by location. For emergencies, we will dispatch a technician \\nwithin 24 hours of determining a technician is needed. For non -emergencies, we will dispatch a technician \\nwithin 48 hours of determining a technician is needed.  \\n \\n4. Cost  \\n \\na. Monthly Cost  \\n The mo nthly cost of the support contract is $ 99 per month  for one -terminal stores, or $ 125 per month for \\ntwo-terminal stores.  \\n \\nb. Payment  \\n \\nBilling and payment for the support contract will be handled in the same manner and timeline in which your \\nroyalty is handled. You will see a separate line -item on your monthly royalty invoice for the cost of the \\nprogram.  \\n \\nc. Changes in Cost  \\n \\nNo more than onc e per year, we will re -evaluate the cost of the program to account for increases and \\ndecreases that may occur in  our cost of administering this service . If we do raise or lower our prices , you will \\nbe notified at least 2 months’  prior to the effective date.  \\n \\n5. Contract Terms  \\n \\nThe support contract will remain active and you will continue to be billed for as long as you own your \\nBIGGBY COFFEE store, except as listed below.  \\n \\na.

In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity ’s preparation\\nand fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are\\nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\\nentity ’s internal control.

No allowances for\\ndoubtful accounts receivable were deem ed necessary  based on managem ent's estimates at December\\n31, 2020 , 2019 , or 2018 .\\nInventory \\nInventory  consists primarily  of supplies and technology  equipm ent for resale to franchisees. Inventory  is\\nstated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO)\\nmethod.\\nProperty and Equipment \\nProperty  and equipm ent are recorded at cost. Both straight-line and accelerated methods are used for\\ncomputing depreciation and amortization. Assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, except\\nin the case of leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the useful life or the remaining term of\\nthe lease, whichever is shorter. Costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred.\\nGift Card Liability \\nThe Company  acts as a clearinghouse for its franchisees' gift card (eCard) transactions. On a quarterly\\nbasis, franchisees are billed or paid for the amount of eCard sales over or under eCard redemptions at the\\nrespective franchisees' store for the period. The gift card liability  represents the amounts owed to\\nfranchisees for unredeemed gift cards. \\nPostemployment Benefits \\nPostemploy ment benefits are recognized as a liability  and expense when the employee accepts the offer\\nand the amount can be reasonably  estimated. The liability  is calculated based upon the estimated present\\nvalue of future benefits to be paid. The benefits are to be paid through June 2022.\\nRevenue Recognition \\nThe Company 's revenue from operations mainly  consists of franchise fees, roy alties, advertising fees, and\\nthe sale of inventory  to franchisees. The Company  sells individual franchisees the right to operate a\\nBiggby  coffee shop within a defined territory  using the franchise name. The initial term of franchise\\nagreements is ty pically  10 y ears for Biggby  Coffee shops or 5 y ears for Milkster locations, with an option to\\nrenew for a fee or transfer the franchise agreement to a new or existing franchisee, at which point a\\ntransfer fee is ty pically  paid. \\n7\", metadata={'source': 'T:\\\\Destktop\\\\m_chatbot\\\\Data\\\\1.pdf', 'page': 293}),\n",

The Company  has concluded that these preopening activities represent\\nperformance obligations to which the franchise fee is allocated. Therefore, initial franchise fees for each\\nagreement are allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as these preopening activities\\nare performed, which typically  aligns with the date a franchisee opens. However, the Company  has\\nconcluded that the franchise fees paid by Milkster franchisees represent a single performance obligation.\\nTherefore, the initial franchise fee for each Milkster franchise agreement is recognized over the term of\\nthe respective franchise agreement from the date the location is opened. Transfer fees and renewal fees\\nare recognized in the period the transfer or renewal agreement is executed. Income for royalties and\\nadvertising fees is recognized over the term of the respective franchise agreement as the underly ing sales\\noccur. Income for the sale of inventory  to franchisees is recognized at the time the product is shipped to\\nthe franchisee. Revenue on the consolidated statement of operations and income has been disaggregated\\naccordingly .\\nThe cumulative effect of change in accounting principle presented on the consolidated statement of\\nmembers' deficit relates to the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update, issued by the Financial\\nAccounting Standards Board, that amends the guidance for revenue recognition. The amendm ent was\\nadopted on January  1, 2019. Under the new standard, Biggby  continues to recognize initial franchise fees\\nupon opening of a franchise location. However, Milkster's franchise fees are now being deferred over the\\ncontract period.\\nPayment Terms\\nInitial franchise and transfer fees are due and typically  paid when a franchise agreement is entered into\\nand are nonrefundable. Royalties and advertising fees are paid on a periodic basis, no longer than\\nmonthly, based upon a percentage of franchisee net sales. Franchise fees are collected prior to the\\nsatisfaction of the Company 's performance obligation for Milkster franchises, resulting in the Company\\nrecognizing contract liabilities. Pay ment for inventory  purchases is due upon receipt of the related goods.\\nAllocating the Transaction Price\\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company  expects to be entitled in\\nexchange for providing franchisees with the franchise rights to operate a franchised location. To determine\\nthe transaction price, the Company  considers its customary  business practices and the terms of the\\nunderly ing agreement. For the purpose of determining transaction prices, the Company  assumes\\nperformance obligations will be satisfied as promised in accordance with franchise agreements and that\\nagreements will not be canceled, renewed, or modified.\\nThe Company 's franchise agreements with franchisees have transaction prices that contain a fixed and\\nvariable component. Variable consideration includes revenue related to royalties and advertising fees, as\\nthe transaction price is based on the franchisees' sales. The license of the franchise right is the\\npredominant item to which the roy alty relates; therefore, the variable consideration is recognized based on\\nthe actual amounts incurred each month. \\nAdvertising Expense \\nIn accordance with the standard franchise agreement, the Company  receives certain advertising fees from\\nits franchises. The goal of the advertising fund is to maximiz e general public recognition and patronage of\\nthe BIGGBY COFFEETM trademarks and systems. Fees assessed in excess of costs incurred are\\nrecorded as unexpended advertising fees, and costs incurred in excess of fees assessed are recorded as\\naccounts receivable. The Company  charges a managem ent fee for administration of the advertising fund,\\nwhich is elim inated in consolidation.\\n8\", metadata={'source': 'T:\\\\Destktop\\\\m_chatbot\\\\Data\\\\1.pdf', 'page': 294}),\n",

Accounting principles generally  accepted in the United States\\nof America (U.S. GAAP) do not include guidance on the accounting for government grants by for-profit\\nentities. As a result, the Company  has elected to analogize to the guidance in International Accounting\\nStandards (IAS) Statem ent 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government\\nAssistance (IAS 20). While IAS 20 does not represent authoritative guidance for entities preparing U.S.\\nGAAP financial statements, use of this guidance by  analogy  is permitted.\\nUnder IAS 20, government grants, including forgivable government loans, are recognized as income when\\nit is probable that the Company  will comply  with the conditions of the grant and that the grant will be\\nreceived. The Company  recognizes proceeds under grant programs in a systematic basis over the period\\nin which the Company  recognizes as expenses the related costs for which the grant is intended to\\ncompensate. The Company  has further elected to record the grant income separately  from the related\\nexpenses in nonoperating income.\\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\\nOn March 11, 2020, the W orld Health Organization declared the outbreak of a respiratory  disease caused\\nby a new coronavirus a pandemic. First identified in late 2019 and now known as COVID-19, the outbreak\\nhas impacted thousands of individuals worldwide. In response, the United States and various state and\\nlocal governments have implem ented measures to combat the outbreak that have severely  impacted\\nbusiness operations. Operations of the Company  were not significantly  impacted, as franchisees were\\nallowed to stay  open throughout the pandemic.\\nNo impairments were recorded as of December 31, 2020; however, the extent of any  future impact cannot\\nbe reasonably  estimated at this time.\\nUpcoming Accounting Pronouncements  \\nThe FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will supersede the current lease\\nrequirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 840. The ASU requires lessees to recognize a\\nright-to-use asset and related lease liability  for all leases, with a limited exception for short-term leases.\\nLeases will be classified as either finance or operating, with the classification affecting the pattern of\\nexpense recognition in the statement of operations. Currently , leases are classified as either capital or\\noperating, with only capital leases recognized on the balance sheet. The reporting of lease-related\\nexpenses in the statements of operations and cash flows will be generally  consistent with the current\\nguidance. The new lease guidance will be effective for the Company 's year ending December 31, 2022\\nand will be applied using a modified retrospective transition method to either the beginning of the earliest\\nperiod presented or the beginning of the y ear of adoption.  The Company  is still evaluating which method it\\nwill apply . The new lease standard is expected to have a significant effect on the Company ’s financial\\nstatements as a result of the Company 's operating leases, as disclosed in Note 10 , that will be reported on\\nthe consolidated balance sheet at adoption. Upon adoption, the Company  will recognize a lease liability\\nand corresponding right-to-use asset based on the present value of the minimum lease payments.
